Train Ticket Booking System

1. Introduction

In today’s digital world, almost everything is shifting towards automation. The railway reservation system is one such area where automation saves time, reduces errors, and makes the entire booking process smoother for both passengers and staff.

This project, Train Ticket Booking System, is a console-based Python application developed to simulate the basic working of an online railway ticket booking system. It provides separate logins for Admin, Customers, and Ticket Checkers (TC) and allows them to perform their specific operations.

I developed this project to understand file handling, object-oriented programming, and real-time ticket booking concepts in Python
2. Problem Statement

In traditional offline railway ticket booking, people have to stand in long queues and the process is slow and time-consuming. Also, managing records manually increases the chance of errors.

This project aims to solve these problems by creating a simple digital system that:

Allows users to sign up and login.

Lets customers book tickets digitally.

Stores ticket data securely using files.

Helps ticket checkers verify tickets using PNR

3. Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:

To create a user-friendly train ticket booking system.

To implement role-based access (Admin, Customer, TC).

To store and retrieve data using file handling with Pickle.

To generate QR codes for tickets.

To maintain route and ticket details effectively

4. Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Libraries Used:

pickle (for file handling)

qrcode (for QR code generation)

pathlib (to check file existence)

random (for PNR generation

5. System Modules

5.1 Admin Module

Admin has the following functionalities:

Admin Signup and Login

Add new locations

Add train routes

Edit or delete existing routes


Admin manages the railway network by creating and updating routes between different locations.

5.2 Customer Module

Customer features include:

Customer Signup and Login

View available train routes

Book tickets

View booking history


Customers can book tickets by selecting source, destination, class, quota, and boarding point

5.3 Ticket Checker (TC) Module

Ticket Checker can:

Login into the system

Verify passenger tickets using PNR number

Check whether a ticket is valid or not


this helps simulate real-world ticket verification on trains.

6. Working of the System

1. User selects their role from the main menu.


2. They login or create a new account.


3. Admin adds routes and manages locations.


4. Customer selects source and destination and books a ticket.


5. A ticket is generated with a unique PNR number.


6. A QR code is generated containing ticket details.


7. TC verifies tickets using PNR stored in the database.



All data is stored using Pickle in .pickle files such as:

adminDict.pickle

custDict.pickle

Route.pickle

ticket_list.pickle

pnr.pickle


7. Data Storage

This system uses Python Pickle to store data such as:

User information

Ticket details

Routes

PNR numbers


This allows data to be saved permanently even after the program is closed.

8. Flow of Program

1. Program starts and shows the main menu.


2. User selects Admin, Customer, or TC.


3. Based on role, respective functions are executed.


4. After operations, user can logout or return to main menu.



9. Advantages

Simple and easy to use interface.

Reduces manual work.
